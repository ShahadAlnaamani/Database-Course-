Part 2 Research

1. Trigger vs stored procedure 
Triggers:
- Initiated when specific event occurs (cannot be directly called) automated action
- Cannot contain transaction statements 
- Maintain the integrity of data and can be used to create logs
- Cannot take parameters 
- Cannot return a value  

Stored procedures: 
- A set of actions that are directly called by the user and prevents code repetition
- Can contain transaction statements
- Can return nothing or return values 
- can take parameters 


2. Stored procedure vs functions 
Stored procedure:
- Good for complex tasks including a lot of logic 
- Can take in parameters 
- Can return nothing, value, table or multiple results 
- Can modify data 
- Can support control flow 
- Can call functions 
- Can contain try/catch
- Can contain transactions 

Function:
- Can take parameters 
- Must return something (value / table)
- Cannot modify data 
- Can preform calculations 
-Cannot support control flow 


3. Drop vs Delete 
Drop:
- DDL
- Affects the structure of the database 
- Used on database objects 
- Cannot be reversed 
- Frees up space in memory

Delete:
- DML 
- Affects the data in the tables 
- Used on actual data 
- Can have clause
- Can be rolled back because it uses buffer
- Does not affect space on memory

4. Select vs Select into 
Select: 
- Outputs results 

Select into: 
- Copies data from one table into another table 

5. DDl vs DML vs DCL vs DQL 
DDL:
- Data definition language 
- Adds, alters and removes objects 
- Commands: Drop, Create, Alter, Truncate, Rename  

DML:
- Data Modification Language 
- Relates to the actual data on the database
- Commands: Insert, Update, Delete

DCL:
- Data control language 
- Controls access 
- Commands:  Grant, Revoke 

TCL:
- TCL (transaction control language)
- create a group of events that have to happen together 
- Commands: Commit, Rollback, set transaction, set constraint 

DQL:
- Data Query Language 
Commands: Select 


6. Table valued vs multi statement function 
Table valued:
- it is a user defined function that returns a table  
- Does not have a begin and end block

Multistatement function:
- TVF is a user defined function that returns a table of rows and columns
- It also requires the creation of the column names
- has a begin and end block

7. Varchar(50) vs varchar(max)
Varchar(50):
- 50 bytes 
- Cannot support Unicode 

Varchar(max):
- Slower to generate 
- Cannot be indexed 
- Can store up to 2GB of data  
- Supports Unicode 
- treated kind of like a table when being created 

8. SQL authentication vs Windows authentication 
SQL:
- solely relies on the username and password directly going to the sql server (additional methods must be implemented to properly secure the database such as SSL encryption)

Windows:
- Uses the devices credentials (certificates) to allow access to the sql server acts like a gateway. 
- Uses Active directory to add security management and centralizes user access management 
- Allows single sign on making -> easier to integrate 


9. Inline function vs view 
Inline: 
- User defined function 
- Function is to prevent repeated code 
- Cannot declare if / while/ try
- Returns a table 

View:
-User defined stored procedure 
- Used to restrict access to the database (Obfuscation)
- Collection of actions that will be done when the view is called


10. Identity and unique constraint  
Identity:
- Added to table column attributes 
- automatically incremented number 
- can be used as the PK 
- Cannot be repeated 

Unique: 
- Added to table column attributes 
- Cannot be repeated 
- Does not need to be an number 
- Can be the PK
